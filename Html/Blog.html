               <h2>On  Education:</h2>
               <p>There is the great saying by <a href="https://georgecouros.ca/blog/about-me">George Couros</a> "Technology will not replace great teachers but technology in the hands of great teachers can be transformational."
                Student and teacher plays an important role in the education
                 through technologies like Laptop, mobile, which made much more strong bond between student 
                 and teacher while asking questions to giving answers.Through technology, many outside resources can be used for the better education.
                 In the study case, students can be able to handle more complex assignments and do more with higher-order skills because of the supports and capabilities provided by technology.

              <h2>On Environment:</h2>
              <p>Many technology devices use in smart home  such as linking sensors and other appliances connected to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">Internet of Things(IoT)</a>
                  that can be remotely monitored and programmed in order to be as energy effivient as much as  possible.Positive effects can be seen on the technology of the internet on the environment due to the fact that social media 
                  can raise the awareness of global issue and worldwide virtual laboratories can be created in the future and electric car can also be the another great benefits in the environment.
                  Hence, if we properly use the technology that we have our environment can be very great.

                <p> Technologies can be a main issue for Physical health such as poor posture, many people use 
                    computer and mobile devices can contribute to bad posture.Over time, this may lead to

                    Many young adults can suffer the back and neck pain due to the excessive use of mobile devices and computer.
                    Correcting posture problems while using  technology can lead to an overall improvement in posture and strength in the core,
                    neck and back.Taking short breaks, such as walking around going out for a while can keep the muscles loose and avoid tension and
                    incorrect posture.

                    Technology makes our life easier but technology can also sparates us from our environment.Through constant update of the technologies
                    many air and water pollution can be seen because of burning of fossil fuels, factories, vechiles.The consequences of air pollution include negative effects for humans, animals and global warning.
                    On the other hand, water pollution can also be seen due of domestic waste and pesticides.Hence,
                    People are ignoring the real environment and being more favarable to the fantasy.

                <p> Technologies, such as social media like <a href="https://touch.facebook.com/"> facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/login?lang=en-gb">Twitter.</a>
                    are establish to bring people together.However,they may have the opposite effect such as isolation. Many researcher found that social media can cause depression and anxiety.The depression and anxiety are seen to below 18 which
                    create negative impact on technologies.
